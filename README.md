# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This guide was created as a means to help others as the navigate through the coding bootcamp course.  In theory, it should remove some stress and create a sense of direction throughout the class.  As I've worked through creating this, I've learned how to work within HTML, CSS and Java code.  Lastly (but far from least!), I've gained some cross-code required knowledge of git and how to use it as a code repository and versioning control solution!
